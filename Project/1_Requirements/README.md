# SECURE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

Secure Water Management System is one of the most important barriers that saves and protect drinking water from theft. With the continuous economic growth, the water demand of enterprises is also increasing. The monitoring of water resource for these enterprises can prevent the occurrence of stealing water and leaking water effectively. Water supply networks form the link between water supply unit and water consumers. These large-scale networks are vital for the survival of life, for maintaining a healthy level of economic development and for the continuous operation of factories and hospitals. In order to implement the proposed water supply system, each consumer end should be provided with an arduino based water flow monitoring system to record the flow rate using a flow sensor.

## RESEARCH

In world, urban water supply systems are public enterprises, usually part of a local government and the recent increased interest in privatizing public enterprises has not led to reforms of water systems. Nevertheless, in about 50 cities in the developing world, the water system either has been privatized or franchised to a non-governmental entity for its operation and maintenance. In this research work, it is proposed to develop an embedded based remote water monitoring and theft prevention system by recording the flow rates at the consumer/user end.
