# 1 ABOUT S.A.F.G.D.S

## 1.1 DESCRIPTION

* Safety automation using fire and gas detection system is a project used to detect the liquid petroleum gas (LPG) leakage to avoid the fire accidents in home and in the industry and increase the safety feature with more accuracy and with more efficiency as we know that security is an important issue. This system detects the leakage of an LPG using gas sensor and also detects the flames or fire using fire sensor. The gas sensor and fire sensor simultaneously collect data from the environment and then transfer it to the Arduino UNO board in the form of analog and digital inputs. The Arduino board then check the inputs and act according to it.

## 1.2 RESEARCH

### 1.2.1 State of art 

* The main aim of this project is to ensure safety condition for that a system has been developed which is reliable in detecting fire and gas leakage and can even detect the specific room or floor in which the fault is present. Moreover, the system can also show an alert message regarding the information of fire detection or gas leakage to the screen. The gas sensor and fire sensor are connected with a microcontroller that will control the total system. In this sense, this device will be helpful for the mankind.
It will make personnelâ€™s life secured and will reduce the loss of assets.

### 1.2.2 Identifying Features

* Intimation of fire using buzzer
* Clearance of gas leakage using exhaust fan
* Gas sensor is used to detect the leakage of gas
* Detection of fire using fire sensor

### 1.2.3 COST

* Medium Cost - The implementation of this project requires medium cost.
