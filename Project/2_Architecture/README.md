## COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION

### Flow Sensor

Flow Sensor is used to sense the water flow rate in solenoid valve. This sensor operates under certain predefined value.

### Arduino UNO

Arduino UNO is used to control the water flow rate by switching on and off the relay through signal received from flow sensor.

### Relay

Relay is used to open and close solenoid valve according to the command received from Arduino UNO.

### Soenoid Valve

Water flows out through solenoid valve.

### GSM 900

GSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communication. It is used to send information such as messages to the municipality.

### LCD

LCD is used to display water flow rate and limit of water.
